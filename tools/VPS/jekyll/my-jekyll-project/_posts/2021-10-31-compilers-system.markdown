# 编译基础

## [Translation unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_unit_(programming))

In C and C++ programming language terminology, a **translation unit** (or more casually a compilation unit) is the ultimate input to a C or C++ compiler from which an object file is generated. **A translation unit** roughly consists of a source file after it has been processed by the C preprocessor, meaning that header files listed in `#include` directives are literally included, sections of code within `#ifndef` may be included, and macros have been expanded. A C++ module is also a translation unit.




## [Single compilation unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_compilation_unit) (编译单元)

**Single compilation unit** (`SCU`) is a computer programming technique for the C and C++ languages, which reduces compilation time for programs spanning multiple files. Specifically, it allows the compiler to keep data from shared header files, definitions and templates, so that it need not recreate them for each file. It is an instance of program optimization. The technique can be applied to an entire program or to some subset of source files; when applied to an entire program, it is also known as a [unity build](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_build).

Example:

For example, if you have the source files `foo.cpp` and `bar.cpp`, they can be placed in a **Single Compilation Unit** as follows:

``` cpp
#include "foo.cpp"
#include "bar.cpp"
```

Suppose `foo.cpp` and `bar.cpp` are:

``` cpp
//foo.cpp
#include <iostream> // A large, standard header
#include "bar.h"    // Declaration of function 'bar'

int main()          // Definition of function 'main'
{
  bar();
}
```

``` cpp
//bar.cpp
#include <iostream> // The same large, standard header

void bar()          // Definition of function 'bar'
{
  ...
}
```

Now the standard header file (`iostream`) is compiled only once, and function `bar` may be inlined into function `main`, despite being from another module.


## [Precompiled header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precompiled_header)

In computer programming, a **precompiled header** (`PCH`) is a (C or C++) header file that is compiled into an intermediate form that is faster to process for the compiler. Usage of precompiled headers may significantly reduce compilation time, especially when applied to large header files, header files that include many other header files, or header files that are included in many translation units.


## [C preprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor)

The **C preprocessor** (`CPP`) is a text file processor that is used with C, C++ and other programming tools. The preprocessor provides for file inclusion (often header files), [macro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)) expansion, [conditional compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_compilation), and line control. Although named in association with C and used with C, the preprocessor capabilities are not inherently tied to the C language. It can and is used to process other kinds of files.


## [Conditional compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_compilation)

In computer programming, **conditional compilation** is a compilation technique which results in differring executable programs depending on parameters specified. This technique is commonly used when these differences in the program are needed to run it on different platforms, or with different versions of required libraries or hardware.

Many programming languages support conditional compilation. Typically [compiler directives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler_directives) define or "undefine" certain variables; other directives test these variables and modify compilation accordingly. For example, not using an actual language, the compiler may be set to define "Macintosh" and undefine "PC", and the code may contain:

``` c
(* System generic code *)
if mac != Null then
    (* macOS specific code *)
else if pc != Null
    (* Windows specific code *)
```

In C and some languages with a similar syntax, this is done using an ['#ifdef' directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor#Conditional_compilation).



## [Interprocedural optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interprocedural_optimization)

**Interprocedural optimization** (`IPO`) is a collection of compiler techniques used in computer programming to improve performance in programs containing many frequently used functions of small or medium length. IPO differs from other compiler optimizations by analyzing the entire program as opposed to a single function or block of code.

`IPO` seeks to reduce or eliminate duplicate calculations and inefficient use of memory and to simplify iterative sequences such as loops. If a call to another routine occurs within a loop, IPO analysis may determine that it is best to [inline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion) that routine. Additionally, IPO may re-order the routines for better memory layout and [locality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_locality).

`IPO` may also include typical compiler optimizations applied on a whole-program level, for example, [dead code elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_code_elimination) (`DCE`), which removes code that is never executed. IPO also tries to ensure better use of constants. Modern compilers offer IPO as an option at compile-time. The actual IPO process may occur at any step between the human-readable source code and producing a finished executable binary program.

For languages that compile on a file-by-file basis, effective IPO across [translation units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_unit_(programming)) (module files) requires knowledge of the "entry points" of the program so that a **whole program optimization** (`WPO`) can be run. In many cases, this is implemented as a **link-time optimization** (`LTO`) pass, because the whole program is visible to the linker.


## [JSON Compilation Database Format Specification](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html) (编译数据库)

Tools based on the **C++ Abstract Syntax Tree** need full information how to parse **a translation unit**. Usually this information is **implicitly** available in the **build system**, but running tools as part of the build system is not necessarily the best solution:

* Build systems are inherently change driven, so running multiple tools over the same code base without changing the code does not fit into the architecture of many build systems.

* Figuring out whether things have changed is often an IO bound process; this makes it hard to build low latency end user tools based on the build system.

* Build systems are inherently sequential in the build graph, for example due to generated source code. While tools that run independently of the build still need the generated source code to exist, running tools multiple times over unchanging source does not require serialization of the runs according to the build dependency graph.


JSON 编译数据库格式规范（JSON Compilation Database Format）是一种用于记录 C/C++ 项目编译信息的标准化格式，其核心目的是让代码分析工具（如静态分析器、代码索引工具等）能够在不依赖原始构建系统的前提下，独立获取并复现单个编译单元的完整编译信息。

具体优势如下：

* 独立于构建系统运行
  + 工具直接读取 JSON 文件中的编译命令，无需与构建系统交互，避免了变更驱动机制的限制。
  + 示例：clang-tidy 静态分析工具可通过该文件直接获取编译参数，无需触发 CMake 的构建流程。

* 减少 IO 开销
  + 编译信息被持久化存储，工具无需反复检查文件系统状态，显著降低延迟。
  + 示例：IDE 可以快速加载 JSON 文件中的编译命令，立即提供代码导航功能。

* 支持并行化处理
  + 工具可并行处理多个编译单元，无需遵循构建系统的串行依赖。
  + 示例：代码索引工具可同时分析多个 .cpp 文件，而无需等待生成代码的任务完成。


JSON 文件格式示例：

一个典型的编译数据库文件（如 `compile_commands.json`）包含多个编译命令条目，每个条目对应一个源文件的编译过程。格式如下：

``` json
[
  {
    "directory": "/path/to/build/dir",
    "file": "src/main.cpp",
    "command": "/usr/bin/clang++ -Iinclude -std=c++17 -c src/main.cpp"
  },
  {
    "directory": "/path/to/build/dir",
    "file": "src/util.cpp",
    "arguments": ["/usr/bin/clang++", "-Iinclude", "-std=c++17", "-c", "src/util.cpp"]
  }
]
```

* `directory`：编译命令执行的工作目录（用于解析相对路径）。
* `file`：源文件的绝对路径或相对于 `directory` 的路径。
* `command` 或 `arguments`：完整的编译命令（字符串形式或拆分后的参数列表）。





# Make (GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs)

The `make` utility will determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them. The manual describes the GNU implementation of make, which was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently maintained by Paul Smith. Our examples show C programs, since they are very common, but you can use make with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell command. In fact, make is not limited to programs. You can use it to describe any task where some files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others change.

To prepare to use make, you must write a file called the `makefile` that describes the relationships among files in your program, and the states the commands for updating each file. In a program, typically the executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.

Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files, this simple shell command: `make`  suffices to perform all necessary recompilations. The make program uses the makefile description and the last-modification times of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated. For each of those files, it issues the commands recorded in the `makefile`.

`make` executes commands in the `makefile` to update one or more target names, where name is typically a program.  If no `-f` option is present, make will look for the makefiles `GNUmakefile`, `makefile`, and `Makefile`, **in that order**.

Normally you should call your makefile either **makefile** or **Makefile**.  (We recommend **Makefile** because it appears prominently near the beginning of a directory listing, right near other important files such as README.)  The first name checked, **GNUmakefile**, is not recommended for most makefiles. You should use this name if you have a makefile that is specific to GNU make, and will not be understood by other versions of make. If makefile is '-', the standard input is read.

`make` updates a target if it depends on **prerequisite files that have been modified since the target was last modified**, or **if the target does not exist**.

# Ninja (a small build system with a focus on speed)

[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible.

对比使用`ninja`和`make`编译[llvm-project-11.0.0.tar.xz](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-11.0.0/llvm-project-11.0.0.tar.xz) ：

> 结论：

* `ninja`在高并发时表现出色，因此对于编译性能要求很高的场景，建议使用`ninja`构建系统。
* 在上文的llvm-project对比测试中，同样由cmake生成编译脚本（`-G Ninja`, `-G "Unix Makefiles"`）的情况下，`ninja`表现明显优于`Makefile`。

## ld (The GNU linker)

> ld [options] objfile ...

`ld` combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in compiling a program is to run `ld`.

refer: [ld(1) - Linux man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ld)

## ld.gold (an official GNU package)

The motivation for writing gold was to make a linker that is faster than the [GNU linker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_linker), especially for large applications coded in C++.

```
# use ld.gold instead of ld for performance
SET(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} -fuse-ld=gold")

# get link stage stats
SET(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS} -Wl,--stats")
SET(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} -Wl,--stats")
```

LLD leaves its name and version number to a `.comment` section in an output. If you are in doubt whether you are successfully using LLD or not, run `readelf --string-dump .comment <output-file>` and examine the output. If the string “Linker: LLD” is included in the output, you are using LLD.

# CCache (a fast C/C++ compiler cache)

`ccache` is a compiler cache. It speeds up recompilation by caching the result of previous compilations and detecting when the same compilation is being done again. Supported languages are C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++.

`ccache` has been carefully written to always produce exactly the same compiler output that you would get without the cache. The only way you should be able to tell that you are using `ccache` is the speed. Currently known exceptions to this goal are listed under CAVEATS. If you ever discover an undocumented case where ccache changes the output of your compiler, please let us know.

There are two ways to use ccache. You can either **prefix your compilation commands with ccache** or you can **let ccache masquerade as the compiler by creating a symbolic link (named as the compiler) to ccache**. The first method is most convenient if you just want to try out ccache or wish to use it for some specific projects. The second method is most useful for when you wish to use ccache for all your compilations.

To use the first method, just make sure that `ccache` is in your `PATH`.

To use the symlinks method, do something like this:

```
cp ccache /usr/local/bin/
ln -s ccache /usr/local/bin/gcc
ln -s ccache /usr/local/bin/g++
ln -s ccache /usr/local/bin/cc
ln -s ccache /usr/local/bin/c++
```

And so forth. This will work as long as the directory with symlinks comes before the path to the compiler (which is usually in `/usr/bin`). After installing you may wish to run “which gcc” to make sure that the correct link is being used.

* Features
  + Keeps statistics on hits/misses.
  + Automatic cache size management.
  + Can cache compilations that generate warnings.
  + Easy installation.
  + Low overhead.
  + Optionally compresses files in the cache to reduce disk space.

* Limitations
  + Only knows how to cache the compilation of a single C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++ file. Other types of compilations (multi-file compilation, linking, etc) will silently fall back to running the real compiler.
  + Only works with GCC and compilers that behave similar enough.
  + Some compiler flags are not supported. If such a flag is detected, ccache will silently fall back to running the real compiler.

## 禁用 ccache

要禁用本地的 ccache，可以采用以下几种方法之一：

* 临时禁用 ccache：

在构建命令之前，将 CCACHE_DISABLE 环境变量设置为 1：

``` bash
export CCACHE_DISABLE=1
```

然后运行构建命令（例如：make）。这将在当前会话中禁用 ccache。

* 永久禁用 ccache：

编辑 ~/.bashrc 或 ~/.bash_profile 文件，将以下行添加到文件末尾：

``` bash
export CCACHE_DISABLE=1
```

保存文件并重新启动终端。这将在所有新的终端会话中禁用 ccache。


* 使用原始的编译器而不是 ccache 包装器

在构建命令中，直接指定原始编译器的路径，而不是使用 ccache 包装器。例如，如果您的原始 Clang 编译器位于 /usr/bin/clang，则可以在构建命令中使用此路径。

``` bash
make CC=/usr/bin/clang
```

这将确保在构建过程中不使用 ccache。

# Mixing Clang with GCC

## [Can Clang compile code with GCC compiled .a libs?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20875924/can-clang-compile-code-with-gcc-compiled-a-libs)

I have my project currently compiling under `gcc`. It uses Boost, ZeroMQ as static `.a` libraries and some `.so` libraries like SDL. I want to go `clang` all the way but not right now. I wonder if it is possible to compile code that uses `.a` and `.so` libraries that were compiled under gcc with clang?

Answers:

Yes, you usually can use `clang` with `GCC` compiled libraries (and vice versa, use `gcc` with `CLANG` compiled libraries), because in fact it is not **compilation**(编译) but **linking**(链接) which is relevant. You might be unlucky and get unpleasant suprises.

You could in principle have some dependencies on the version of `libstdc++` used to link the relevant libraries (if they are coded in C++). Actually, that usually does not matter much.

In C++, [name mangling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling) might in theory be an issue (there might be some corner cases, even incompatibilities between two different versions of `g++`). Again, in practice it is usually not an issue.

So usually you can mix `CLANG` (even different but close versions of it) with `GCC` **but you may have unpleasant surprises**. **What should be expected from any C++ compiler (be it `CLANG` or `GCC`) is just to be able to compile and link an entire software (and all libraries) together using the same compiler and version (and that includes the same [C++ standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Standard_Library) implementation). This is why upgrading a compiler in a distribution is a lot of work**: the distribution makers have to ensure that all the packages compile well (and they do get surprises!).

Beware that the version of `libstdc++` does matter. Both `Clang` & `GCC` communities **work hard to make its ABI compatible for compiler upgrades, but there are subtle corner cases**. Read the documentation of your particular and specific C++ standard library implementation. These corner cases could explain mysterious crashes when using a good C++ library binary (compiled with `GCC 5`) in your code compiled with `GCC 8`. The bug is not in the library, **but the ABI evolved incompatibly**.

Another answers:

At least for [Crypto++ library](http://www.cryptopp.com/) this does not work (verified :-( ). So for c++ code it is less likely to work, while pure c code would probably link OK.

The solution appears to be: **if you need to compile C++ code with clang, and link it to a gcc-compiled library**, use `clang++ -stdlib=libstdc++`. The linking is successful, and the resulting binary runs correctly.

CAVEAT(注意): It does not seem to work the other way: even though you can build a library compiled with "clang++ -stdlib=libstdc++" and link gcc-compiled code with it, this code will crash with SEGV. So far I found the only way to link with a clang-compiled library is compiling your code with clang, not gcc.

## [gcc vs clang common library issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49715462/gcc-vs-clang-common-library-issue?noredirect=1&lq=1)

I have two applications, one compiled with gcc(c++) and another compiled with clang++. I am to use common shared boost library for both the applications. My question is whether to compile boost shared library using clang compiler or gcc compiler. Can I use boost library compiled with gcc in my application that is being compiled using clang?

Answers:

`g++` and `clang++` are compatible as compilers (because they both follow the `Itanium ABI`), **but they may come with incompatible standard library implementations**.

`g++` comes with a standard library implementation called `libstdc++`. You can direct g++ to use a different implementation but this is not exactly trivial.

`clang++` sometimes comes without a standard library implementation of its own (and is configured to use implementation provided by `g++`), and sometimes comes with an implementation called `libc++`. One can easily switch `clang++` to use either `libc++` or `libstdc++` with a single command line option.

**So your question boils down to what standard library implementation(s) your applications use.** If they use the same implementation, you need to build Boost with that implementation (and either compiler). If they use different implementations, you need two separate builds of Boost.

Mixing components built against different standard library implementations in the same application can sometimes be done, but is not straightforward, entails a lot of restrictions, and with things like boost is either not feasible or downright impossible.
