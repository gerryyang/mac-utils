# [Elasticsearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch)

**Elasticsearch** is a [search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_(computing)) based on the [Lucene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucene) library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.

Elasticsearch is developed in Java and is dual-licensed under the source-available Server Side Public License and the Elastic license, while other parts fall under the proprietary (source-available) Elastic License. Official clients are available in Java, .NET (C#), PHP, Python, Ruby and many other languages. According to the DB-Engines ranking, Elasticsearch is the most popular enterprise search engine.
