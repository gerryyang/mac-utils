## Trump administration owes Americans answers about restrictions on Huawei (2019-5-23)

From: `The Washington Post` 华盛顿邮报

> 美媒：打压华为的特朗普，欠民众一个解释
> restrictions on sth. eg: strict restrictions on commercial activities.

Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei's global influence has been steadily growing in recent years, and the U.S. goverment's concern has been growing along with it.

> 近年来，中国电信巨头华为的全球影响力稳步增加，美国政府的担忧也随之加深。
> telecommunication n. 电信，长途电信。`tele-` 远的，远距离的，television，远距离传输图像，电视

Fearing that the spread of *Chinese-made cellphones, routers and other equipment* may render Western countries, *including those that share the most sensitive intelligence with the United States*, vulnerable to Beijing, Washington has tried to hold Huawei accountable for **alleged intellectual-property theft** while discouraging key allies such as Britain, Australia and New Zealand from relying on Huawei technology.

> 因为害怕中国制造的手机，路由器和其他设备，可能使得西方国家（包括那些和美国共享最敏感情报的国家）在中国面前不堪一击，美国政府企图让华为为所谓的窃取知识产权行为负责。与此同时，美国还阻挠其重要盟友们（如英国，澳大利亚和新西兰）使用华为提供的技术。
> Fearing that the spread of sth may render Western countires, vulnerable to Beijing.
> render = make, 因为害怕sth，会使西方国家，在中国面前非常脆弱，不堪一击。
> the most sensitive intelligence 最敏感的情报
> accountable = responsible, 新闻里的常见说法: 让某人为某事负责，hold someone accountable for sth.
> intellectual-property theft 窃取知识产权，alleged 据说，据称。
> discourage someone from doing sth 阻止某人做某事。

*What's ultimately at stake here* is the future of 5G networks around the world - the ultrafast connection systems *that will soon link smartphones, enable driverless automobiles and, potentially, revolutionize warfare*.

> 把话说到底，现在处在危险境地的是全世界5G网络的未来，5G网络这一超高速的连接系统，很快就可以连接智能手机，能让无人驾驶汽车变成现实，并且有可能为战争的形式带来革新。
> be at stake/sth at stake. 处于危险境地，处于成败关头。
> eg:
> The lives of wild animals are at stake. 野生动物的性命危在旦夕。
> There are many interests at stake. 很多利益受到影响。
> ultimately 终极的，最终的
> ultrafast 超高速的
> revolutionize 使发生革命性巨变，The new theory will revolutionize modern science. 新理论会使现代科技发生革命性的变化。
> war 广义的战争，或具体的战争
> warfare 战争进行的方式，或手段

Now the Trump administration has escalated to a new level, requiring that all U.S. firms seek federal approval before selling to Huawei.

> 现在，特朗普政府已经（把对华为的限制）上升到了一个新的高度，要求所有美国公司在向华为销售产品前，寻求联邦政府的批准。
> escalate 上升

Though not an outright ban on sales, it is a major restriction because Huawei's products rely on inputs purchased from no fewer than 30 U.S. companies, and now those will be subject to government licensing. Huawei says it has stockpiled a 12 month-supply of U.S.-made inputs in anticipation of just such a move.

> 尽管这不是一个针对销售下达的彻底的禁令，但它也确实是一个严格的限制，因为华为的产品依赖于从不下30家美国公司购入的零件，而现在那些零件交易需要获得政府的许可。华为表示，正是因为预见了这样的变化，他们已经囤积了足够使用12个月的美国产零件。
> outright 直截了当的，彻底的。an outright refusal 直截了当的拒绝
> no fewer than 不少于
> government licensing 政府许可。
> be subject to 受制于。
> stockpile 大量储备。
> in anticipation of 预期。I have postponed our meeting in anticipation of his procrastination. 我估计他会拖延，所以推迟了我们的会以。
> move 举措，决定。

If the Trump administration's latest step represents a deliberate attempt to bring down Huawei, **it is not justified**. In that sense, the administration owes the public more transparency about its intentions.

> 如果特普朗政府的最新举措展示了其有意搬到华为的企图，那么这一举措缺乏正当理由。从这个意义上说，政府应该让其意图对公众有更高的透明度。
> deliberate 故意的，蓄意的。在其他语境，也表示，深思熟虑，小心谨慎地。a deliberate attempt 蓄意的企图。
> transparency 透明度。


# X Employee Satisfaction Survey (2024 X 公司满意度调查)

You are Invited to Take the 2024 `X` Employee Satisfaction Survey (This email is exclusively for you, please do not forward it to others)

Dear colleague,

This year marks the 26th anniversary of `X`. Looking back, we took decisive actions in response to a rapidly changing environment two years ago, and we are now seeing the fruits of those efforts. Our businesses and teams have gained **momentum** (/məˈmentəm/ n. 冲力), and we've seen an improvement in the company's performance, quarter by quarter. **We have shown that we can not only capitalize on favorable circumstances, but also manage to emerge from difficult times**.

`X` has conducted the Employee Satisfaction Survey for 20 years and we've gained many valuable insights from employees' feedback. For example, we came to realize that we had lost some of our passion and ambition under the weight of **cumbersome** (/ˈkʌmbəsəm/ adj. 笨重的；繁琐的，复杂的) rules, processes, and ways of doing things. And there had been a **widespread** (adj. 普遍的，广泛的) feeling that many good ideas had been wasted, many talented individuals were unrecognized, and numerous internal obstacles **had hindered** (阻碍) our progress toward our goals. Therefore, we call on everyone to voice your thoughts, opinions, and even **criticisms** (n. 批评). We also believe that your honest feedback will help us continuously improve as a company and foster organizational **vitality** (/vaɪˈtæləti/ n. 活力，热情；生机，生命力).

We are looking forward to seeing your responses to the 2024 `X` Employee Satisfaction Survey.


`X` 的小伙伴：

今年是 `X` 成立的第26年，近两年面对各种环境气候变化时，我们果断行动，也收获了成效：业务和团队的状态稳步回暖，公司业绩每个季度都在提升。这让所有人看到，`X` 不只能在顺流中抓住机会，也能在疾风巨浪中逆流而上。

满意度调查到今年已经是第20个年头，在大家通过各种渠道反馈的问题和建议中，我们看到、感受到，我们的激情与锐气正被一些繁琐的规则、流程、套路框住，导致很多好的想法跑不出来，不少优秀的人才不能被看到，做成一件事有时有重重阻碍。我们鼓励每一位员工真实地表达自己的想法看法，即使是批评。我们也相信，你真实的表达，一定能帮助组织不断进步，激发活力。

在此，公司期望通过“2024年员工满意度调查”来继续了解你对于公司各维度的真实的想法，期待各位诚挚的发声，助推公司历久弥新，与时俱进。


# Happy Teachers' Day: Each of Us Has the Potential to Empower Others (September 10th, 2024)

Dear colleagues,

Today is Teachers' Day in China, a day in which we celebrate and show appreciation towards our educators. I'd like to wish all of our **lecturers**(讲师), **mentors**(导师), and every `T`er who is passionate about sharing knowledge a wonderful Teachers' Day!

There's an old saying in China that goes, "**In a group of three, there is always at least one person you can learn from.(三人行，必有我师焉)**" This **adage**(n. 名言) echoes strongly with `T`'s inspiring journey of growth. From its humble beginning as a startup about 26 years ago, `T` has risen to become a global leader in the Internet industry, thanks to the tireless efforts and collective wisdom of every `T`er. Each individual brings a unique set of skills, experiences, and perspectives to the table, and is thus a valuable asset to `T`'s success.

At `T`, we're committed to building a culture of openness, inclusion, and sharing. Regardless of your level of experience or expertise, we value your unique perspective and encourage you to share your knowledge with others. In honor of this commitment, we offer an abundance of learning resources and exchange opportunities that enable every `T`er to grow and thrive.

Over the past year, we have redoubled our efforts in knowledge management and sharing. Through the collaborative efforts of `T` Academy, our career development committees, the KM platform (the internal online knowledge management community), and the Corporate Culture Department, we launched our first internal professional publication - `T` Profession. Released on July 15, 2014, `T` Profession features 31 carefully curated articles from thousands of submissions by our talented employees. To date, it has been viewed by an impressive 60%+ of `T`ers. We have increased incentives for high-quality courses and sharing, and upgraded the Q-Learning platform to make knowledge production more efficient and the learning experience better. These efforts have significantly enhanced the convenience and efficiency of learning for our employees.

In addition, we also launched the Excellent Knowledge Management Award across the company. This Award aims to recognize those teams that have made outstanding contributions to knowledge management and sharing, and to inspire more teams to join this effort. Through these initiatives, we seek to build a comprehensive knowledge transfer mechanism and make `T` a better organization for learning.

At `T`, everyone can be a "teacher" who empowers others and also a "student" who learns from peers. We exchange our insights and experiences throughout our work to drive each other's growth. This spirit of mutual mentorship not only promotes the advancement of each individual but also brings continuous **momentum**(n. 动力) to the company's innovation and development.

On this special day, I would like to extend my gratitude to everyone who has contributed to the growth and development of `T`ers. More importantly, we hope more and more people can join us in helping and influencing others with our knowledge and wisdom. Let's **unleash**(v. 释放出) our passion for learning and knowledge at `T`, and propel the company to new heights.

亲爱的`T`小伙伴们，大家好！

今天是一年一度的教师节，祝我们身边的每一位讲师、导师以及热爱分享的`T`人教师节快乐！

“三人行，必有我师焉。”这句古人的名言，在`T`得到了生动的体现。在过去的26年里，`T`从一个小小的创业公司成长为全球领先的互联网企业，这离不开每一位`T`人的努力和智慧。我们每一个人都是`T`这个宝库中的宝贵财富，都有着自己的专长和经验。

 在`T`，我们鼓励开放、包容和分享的文化。无论是资深的大咖大神，还是初出茅庐的新人小白，每个人都有机会展示自己的才华和智慧。我们为大家提供了丰富的学习资源和交流机会。

过去一年，我们加大了对知识沉淀和分享的投入力度。`T`学堂、各专业通道、KM及企业文化部联合推出首本公司级的专业刊物——《`T`知点》年刊，从上千篇员工投稿中严格评选出31篇最具代表性的专业文章，于2024年7月15日正式发布，目前已有超过六成小伙伴阅读了年刊文章。与此同时，我们加大了内部精品课程和分享的激励力度，升级了QLearning学习平台，提升了知识生产效率和学习体验，让学习变得更加便捷和高效。

此外，我们还首次开展了`T`知识沉淀优秀团队评选活动，旨在表彰那些在知识沉淀和分享方面做出突出贡献的团队，激励更多团队加入到这一行列中来。通过这些举措，我们希望能够构建一个更加完善的知识传承体系，让`T`成为一个更好的学习型组织。

在`T`，每一个人都是老师，也是学生。我们在工作中相互学习、共同进步，分享着彼此的经验和见解。这种互为师长的精神不仅促进了个人的成长和发展，也为公司的持续创新和发展带来了源源不断的动力。

最后，感谢每一位为`T`人的成长和发展做出贡献的老师！同时，也期待更多的小伙伴能够加入到“老师”的行列中来，用自己的知识和智慧去影响和帮助更多的人。让我们一起庆祝这个属于我们大家的节日，互勉互助、一起迈入next level！


# Stay Focused and Create Value (保持专注，创造价值)

In a few hours, we'll bid farewell to 2024 and welcome 2025. First and foremost, we would like to wish everyone a happy New Year! Thank you so much for your efforts over the past year. Together, we have overcome great challenges and maintained stable, high-quality growth. More importantly, we have sharpened our focus and reinvented ourselves in the face of adversity. These strengths will be invaluable as we move forward.

2025 will present us with both challenges and opportunities, driven by economic volatility (经济周期波动起伏) and intensified market competition (市场竞争加剧) across the world.


再过十几个小时，我们即将告别2024，迈入2025。首先祝大家新年快乐！非常感谢所有腾讯人的努力，让我们在过去一年经受住了宏观考验，保持了稳定、高质量的发展。尤其难得的是，在困难中磨炼了我们专注与自我革新的能力，这将是我们走向未来最宝贵的财富。

放眼世界，各种不稳定因素依旧活跃，经济周期波动起伏，市场竞争加剧，2025年我们面对的仍然是一个充满挑战与机遇的未来。
